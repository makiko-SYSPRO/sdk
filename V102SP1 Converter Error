Hello,

I installed official release version of COMOS WI(x86) issue on 2017 Feb 17, then applied translation folder named ja-JP under installed program folder.
I found several comverters were not start up, nor log information.
  1) PDS Converter
  2) JT Converter
  3) SP3D Conveter
  4) Point Could Converter
  
  Only PDMS started up with Japanese interface.
  If I rename ja-JP folder under isntallation program, all converters worked but with English interface.
  
  Please refine all converters to behaive same as PDMS builder.
  
  
  Regards,
  
  
  Makiko
